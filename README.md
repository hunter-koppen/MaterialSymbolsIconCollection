## About Icon Collections
Icon collections are new in Mendix, you can read about them in the documentation here:
https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/icon-collection/

They basically work the same as the Glyphicons where you can simply use font-size and color on the image and it will change size and color directly. Sadly not all widget support the new Icon Collections yet but most new Mendix widgets do. For example the Image widget that Mendix released not too long ago support the new Icons Collections.
